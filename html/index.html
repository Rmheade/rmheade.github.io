            <p class="bodytext">On the other three pages, I have made projects that you should try! They should be a good challenging projet to undertake so you can learn HTML.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">This will require:</p>
            <ul class="bodytext">
                <li>Knowledge of how to structure with HTML</li>
                <li>Undertanding of CSS formatting</li>
                <li>And undertanding of JS logic</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytext">Just remember, using Google is OK. If you don't know something, reasearch it! I cannot teach you everything myself.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">If you give up, you can go to the github repository - linked at the top right corner - to see the answer. Details are in the repositories readme file.</p>
            <hr style="width: 95%">
            <h3 class="bodytext">The actual assignment is not to directly re-create these pages. Rather, try to get the same functionality. It is okay if you cannot match it in looks or feel. The important part is that by the end you will understand how website like this are made, and be able to make a similar one.</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Do them in this order so that you can learn as you go</p>
            <ol class="bodytext">
                <li>Simple Page -> Practice laying out an HTML page and formatting it to your pleasure</li>
                <li>Guessing Game -> Learn simple JS and coding logic.</li>
                <li>Dino Game -> have some fun by using more advanced JS to make a fun game.</li>
